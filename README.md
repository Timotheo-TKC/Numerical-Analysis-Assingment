b) Using PYTHON  show how the following is achieved(PRACTICAL) 
       i. Differentiation 
       ii.Numerical integration 
       iii.Curve Fitting  
       iv.Linear Regression 
       v.Spline Interpolation 

c.A smart  robotic agent with a laser Scanner is doing a quick quality check on holes drilled 
in a   rectangular plate. The centers  of the hole in the plate describes the path the arm 
needs to take, and the  hole centers are located on a Cartesian coordinate system as shown  
X (in) 
2.00 
4.25 
5.25 
7.81 
9.20 
Y(in) 
7.2 
7.1 
6.0 
5.0

If the laser scanner is traversing from x=2.00  to   x =4.25  in a linear path, what is the value 
of y at x= 4.0  using the linear spline formula , show how this problem can be solved using 
PYTHON (PRACTICAL)  


g. Write a program to show how the trapezoidal rule of integration works  in PYTHON  
(PRACTICAL)
